                <p>My Dad is a keen photographer and I remember playing with old 35mm bodies as a child. Maybe this was an early influence, who knows, but I don't remember taking too many photographs growing up. I was fairly artistic as a teenager which resulted in taking an A-level in photography but I didn't really pick a camera up much after that.</p>

                <p>It was on a gap year to the well trodden haunts of South East Asia and Australia where I picked up a camera with a real sense of purpose again. Looking back, I think being dropped into totally new countries and situations was the inspiration along with wanting to capture places that I might only get one chance to visit.</p>

                <p>In the last 10 years I've been lucky enough to work in the editorial photography business in a variety of roles. The quantity of images I see on a a daily basis is often mind boggling but the pictures of foreign countries and different cultures are still the ones that still catch my attention.</p>
